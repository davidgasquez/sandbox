# Sandbox Playground

Just a sandbox environment that can be used to play around with new technologies.

## Getting Started

There are two branches available besides `main`:

- [`ipfs`](https://github.com/davidgasquez/sandbox/tree/ipfs)
- [`data`](https://github.com/davidgasquez/sandbox/tree/data)

Both have a Development Container configured, so you can just open the project in VS Code and start tinkering around!
